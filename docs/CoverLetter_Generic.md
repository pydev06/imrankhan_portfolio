Dear [HIRING_MANAGER_NAME / Hiring Team],

I am writing to express my interest in the **[POSITION_TITLE]** position at **[COMPANY_NAME]**, as advertised on [JOB_BOARD / SOURCE]. With 9+ years of experience in software engineering, specializing in Python, full-stack development, and Generative AI, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to your team.

In my current role as a **Senior Software Engineer** at SII Group, I lead the development of mission-critical engineering tools for **Airbus (France)**, building scalable solutions using Python, FastAPI, and Docker. I have successfully delivered multiple production-grade applications — from web-based resource scheduling systems to automation engines — that are actively used across Airbus' internal engineering workflows. [ADD_1-2_SENTENCES_ABOUT_HOW_YOUR_EXPERIENCE_SPECIFICALLY_MATCHES_THE_JOB_REQUIREMENTS].

What excites me about [COMPANY_NAME] is [COMPANY_VALUE_OR_MISSION_OR_PRODUCT_THAT_RESONATES]. [EXPLAIN_WHY_THIS_MATTERS_TO_YOU_IN_1-2_SENTENCES]. I believe my background in [SPECIFIC_SKILL_1] and [SPECIFIC_SKILL_2], combined with my passion for [RELEVANT_DOMAIN], makes me well-suited to [SPECIFIC_CONTRIBUTION_YOU_CAN_MAKE].

Beyond my professional work, I actively explore AI and GenAI through personal projects. I have built an **AI-powered resume shortlisting system** using OpenAI GPT-4o and a **EU Job Navigator** leveraging RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with ChromaDB — both deployed and live. These projects demonstrate my commitment to staying at the forefront of AI engineering and my ability to deliver end-to-end solutions independently.

I am [OPEN_TO_RELOCATION / AVAILABLE_FOR_REMOTE_WORK / AVAILABLE_TO_START_FROM_DATE] and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with the goals of your team. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.
